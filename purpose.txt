I want to:
Add a new CLI flag called --suppress-error with options like =permission or =nopermission
Implement error filtering in the search pipeline to silently skip files with permission errors

Consider:
2 variants of the flag:
- One that silences the errors (exit code stays 2)
- One that skips files entirely (exits successfully)

Files to modify:
- crates/cli/src/args.rs
- crates/core/main.rs
- crates/searcher/src/searcher/glue.rs

Add tests
